    <h1>Daft Punk</h1>
        <p>Daft Punk is a French electronic music duo consisting of producers Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter.[5][6][7][8] The two achieved significant popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement, and were met with continuous success in the years following, combining elements of house music with funk, techno, disco, rock, and synthpop influences.[2][6][7][9] They are also known for their visual stylization and disguises associated with their music; specifically, the duo have worn ornate helmets and gloves to assume robot personas in most of their public appearances since 2001. They rarely grant interviews or appear on television.</p>
        
        <p>Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were originally in an indie rock band called Darlin' together, which disbanded after a short period of time, leaving the two to experiment musically with drum machines and synthesizers. The duo became Daft Punk, releasing their debut album Homework on Virgin Records in 1997 to highly positive reviews. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records.[10] The 2001 release of Discovery was even more successful, driven by the club singles "One More Time", "Digital Love", and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger". In March 2005, the duo released the album Human After All to mixed reviews. However, the singles "Robot Rock" and "Technologic" achieved success in the United Kingdom.</p>
        
        <p>Daft Punk toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album Alive 2007, which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album. The duo composed the score of the film Tron: Legacy in 2010 and released its soundtrack album. In January 2013, Daft Punk left Virgin Records for Sony Music Entertainment's subsidiary label Columbia, and released Random Access Memories in 2013 to worldwide critical acclaim. The album's lead single "Get Lucky" became an international success, peaking in the top 10 in 32 countries. Random Access Memories led to five Grammy wins in 2014, including Album of the Year as well as Record of the Year for "Get Lucky".</p>
        
    <h2>1987–93: Early career</h2>
        <p>Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo met in 1987 while attending the Lycée Carnot, a secondary school in Paris.[8][11] The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with others from the school. This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group called Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992.[12] Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz performed on drums.[13] The trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition.[14] Stereolab released both tracks on a multi-artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom.[14][15] Bangalter felt that "The rock n' roll thing we did was pretty average, I think. It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it."[16] A negative review in Melody Maker by Dave Jennings[17] subsequently dubbed the music "a daft punky thrash."[18] Instead of dismissing the review, they found it amusing.[11] As de Homem-Christo stated, "We struggled so long to find [the name] Darlin', and this happened so quickly."[19] Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix.[12] Bangalter and de Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers.</p>
        
        <h2>1993–99: Homework</h2>
        <p>In September 1993, Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, co-founder of the label Soma Quality Recordings.[11] The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, "The New Wave", a limited release in 1994.[16] The single also contained the final mix of "The New Wave" called "Alive", which was to be featured on Daft Punk's first album.</p>
        <p>Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record "Da Funk". It became the duo's first commercially successful single the same year. After the success of "Da Funk", Daft Punk looked to find a manager. The duo eventually settled on Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted it and other artists at his Hype night clubs.[13] The band signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal through which the duo licensed its tracks to the major label through its production company, Daft Trax.[8][13] Bangalter spoke of the duo's decision to sign with Virgin:</p>
